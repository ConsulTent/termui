## TODO

- moved widgets to `github.com/gizak/termui/widgets`
- rewrote widgets (check examples and code)
- rewrote grid
  - grids are created locally instead of through `termui.Body`
  - grids can be nested
  - changed grid layout mechanism
    - columns and rows can be arbitrarily nested
    - column and row size is now specified as a ratio of the available space
- `Buffer` `Cell`s now contain an `AttrPair` which holds a `Fg` and `Bg`
- Change `Bufferer` interface to `Drawable`
  - Add `GetRect` and `SetRect` methods to control widget sizing
  - Change `Buffer` method to `Draw`
    - `Draw` takes a `Buffer` and draws to it instead of creating a new one
- Created a global `Theme` struct which holds the default `Attributes` of everything
- Combined `TermWidth` and `TermHeight` functions into `TerminalSize`
- Added `Canvas` which allows for drawing braille lines to a `Buffer`
- Refactored `Block`
- Refactored `Buffer` methods
- Set `termbox-go` to 256 colors by default

Feel free to search/open an issue if something is missing or confusing.
